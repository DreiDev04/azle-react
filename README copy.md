## Disclaimer

This project was originally intended to be a submission for the Internet Computer Developer Grant Round 6. Unfortunately, the developers were not able to complete the project in time for the deadline and as such, it is not yet feature complete. At the moment, the project is still in its early stages and is not yet a viable product. The developers learned a lot throughout the process and are happy to have had the opportunity to share their work with the community.
